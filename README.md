## Google Summer of Code (GSoC) projects and products related to [Orcasound](http://orcasound.net/support#hack) and orca sounds!

[Orcasound is a mentoring organization](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5399523129556992/) for [Google Summer of Code (2020)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). We are an open-source project building cool tech that makes it easy for humans and machines to listen for whales. With the primary goal of helping the endangered orcas of the Pacific Northwest (near Seattle, WA, USA), we are connecting citizen scientists and conservation activists with the amazing sounds these wild killer whales make as they move past our underwater microphones (aka hydrophones) in pursuit of their favorite food -- Pacific salmon.

Orcasound aims to recruit talented GSoC students to help us advance the field of bioacoustics with open-source software (and hardware). All code contributed by GSoC students will be shared under open-source licenses and any data products derived from Orcasound data will be shared under [Orcasound's Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

In the [Issues](https://github.com/orcasound/orcagsoc/issues) section of this repository, we list project ideas from mentors. Orcasound also encourages you -- as a GSoC student -- to propose your own original project ideas (as new issues). 

After you [sign up as a GSoC student](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/student-signup/) please refer to the [Orcasound Contribution Guide](https://github.com/orcasound/orcagsoc/blob/master/STUDENT-contribution-guide.md) and the [Orcasound Proposal Template](https://github.com/orcasound/orcagsoc/blob/master/STUDENT-proposal-template.md) as you draft your proposal.
