## Google Summer of Code (GSoC) projects and products related to [Orcasound](http://orcasound.net/support#hack) and orca sounds!

Orcasound values teaching about open source coding through the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). We are an open source project building cool tech that makes it easy for humans and machines to listen for whales. With the primary goal of helping the endangered orcas of the Pacific Northwest (near Seattle, WA, USA), we are connecting citizen scientists and conservation activists with the amazing sounds these wild killer whales make as they move past our underwater microphones (aka hydrophones) in pursuit of their favorite food -- Pacific salmon.

Orcasound aims to recruit talented GSoC participants to help us advance the field of bioacoustics with open source software (and hardware). All code contributed by GSoC participants will be shared under open source licenses and any data products derived from Orcasound data will be shared under [Orcasound's Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

In the [Issues](https://github.com/orcasound/orcagsoc/issues) section of this repository, we list project ideas from mentors. Orcasound also encourages you -- as a GSoC participant -- to propose your own original project ideas (as new issues). If you'd like more details about previous projects and products, you'll find technical details and links to additional information in the [orcagsoc wiki](https://github.com/orcasound/orcagsoc/wiki). Don't miss the advice and tips offered in the wiki from past GSoC participants who have worked with Orcasound in past years (2020, 2021)!

After you [sign up as a GSoC participant](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started/) please refer to the [Orcasound Contribution Guide](GSoC-contributor-guide.md) and the [Orcasound Proposal Template](GSoC-contributor-proposal-template.md) as you draft your proposal.

# Questions?

Ask GSoC-specific questions in the #GSoC channel of the [Orcasound Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/orcasound/shared_invite/zt-1jr7te193-ObLYcTxx4s7SO7EA9kmcaw). Please do not begin by sending direct messages to the mentors on Slack. You will get a response quicker in the #GSoC channel, plus by conversing there the community will benefit not only from your good questions, but also any advice and knowledge you are offered.

Once on-boarded, you may also discuss general open source software and hardware development questions within the [Orcasound dev email distribution list](http://lists.orcasound.net/listinfo.cgi/dev-orcasound.net). However, if you are on Slack you will get faster responses in the #dev-general channel. Specific coding or architecture questions should be posed within the relevant Github issue.
